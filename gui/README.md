Uses [`pyautogui`](https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui) to control the mouse
and keyboard to copy and paste text as you'd do physically. Although this should
be perfect, there are some caveats due to bugs in the Notes app, such as HTML
markup not appearing on the Mac Notes app, while they do in the iPhone app. As
such, the [`ios-1x`](https://github.com/pat-laugh/notes-to-text/tree/master/ios-1x) can be preferable.
